Setting up your Board
---------------------
1. udev rules: copy helpers/99-USBasp.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d/ (this assumes you are using the USBasp programmer, update your IDE accordingly)
2. Add the board to Arduino IDE: Unzip helpers/5ohBee.tar.gz in your Arduino sketch directory, restart the IDE, and set your board to "ATmega128RFA1 Dev Board" (under "Sparkfun AVR Boards")
3. Install dependencies: In the IDE, select "Sketch" -> "Include Library" -> "Add .ZIP Library..." to add helpers/SmartResponseXE-lib.zip to the project
4. ???
5. Profit! Add the contents of the sketch directory to your workspace, compile, and upload!
